This is a commission project where I created a web application that applies MVC architectural design. (Mode-View-Controller). 
Doing this project helped me learn how to use Visual Studio 2022's capabilities.
**What it does?**
 This is a mood tracker web application where the user can register or login. Using this the application applies a simple authentication to make sure unauthenticated users will not be able to view specific pages.
it also has a CRUD functionality for Mood ledger. It also uses a local database that stores the user data and the inputted mood by the user.
